#### Challenge

The attached *firmware image* implements a number of unknown functions in "vendor requests" -- control requests with vendor-defined behaviors. 

Using the attached exploration example, experiment with various vendor requests and see what you can find! 

*Note that the binary is the same for each instance of Example 1. You'll know which flag you've found once you've found it, as it will start with the challenge number.*
