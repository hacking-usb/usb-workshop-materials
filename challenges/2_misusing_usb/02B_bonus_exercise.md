#### Challenge

The attached firmware binary is similar to the binary from the previous exercise -- but it's been coded a lot more sloppily!

Experiment with both standard and vendor requests, and see if you can find any flags! As a general hint, consider each of the fields of the *setup packet* -- these are the values you have the best opportunity to manipulate!
